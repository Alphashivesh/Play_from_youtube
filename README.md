You are needed to add your API Key:
          const YOUTUBE_API_KEY = "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX";

          
          (in the App.js file in order to run the app.)

Project Title: React YouTube Music Player with Search & Suggestions

Overview:
This project is an interactive web application built using React that allows users to search for music videos on YouTube,
receive real-time search suggestions, view a list of results, and play the selected video directly within a custom-styled interface.
It leverages the official YouTube Data API for searching and the YouTube IFrame Player API for embedding and controlling playback.

Core Features:
YouTube Video Search: Implements search functionality using the YouTube Data API v3 to find videos based on user queries
(song titles, artists, etc.), biased towards a specific region (e.g., India/Bollywood).

Real-time Search Suggestions: Provides autocomplete suggestions as the user types into the search bar, 
utilizing an undocumented Google suggestions endpoint (requires CORS proxy handling).
Suggestions are fetched using a debounced approach to limit API calls.

Dynamic Results Display: Fetched search results are displayed in a clean, scrollable list featuring video thumbnails, titles, and channel names.

Integrated Video Playback: Embeds the YouTube IFrame Player to play the selected video. Users can see the video playing within the application layout.

Playback State Management: Tracks basic playback state (playing/paused) and reflects it visually in the UI.

Customizable & Modern UI: Features a responsive, "fashionable" user interface styled using modern CSS techniques,
including CSS Variables for theming, Flexbox/Grid for layout, and subtle transitions/shadows.

Component-Based Architecture: Built with React components (App, YouTubePlayer) for modularity and maintainability,
utilizing React Hooks (useState, useEffect, useRef, useCallback) for state and lifecycle management.

Technology Stack:
Frontend: React (v18+ with Hooks)
Styling: CSS3 (with CSS Variables, Flexbox, Grid)

APIs:
YouTube Data API v3 (for searching)
YouTube IFrame Player API (for playback)
Google Suggest Queries API (undocumented, for suggestions)

Language: JavaScript (ES6+)

Key Implementation Details:
Asynchronous fetching (fetch) of search results and suggestions.
Dynamic loading and interaction with the external YouTube IFrame Player API script.
State management for search terms, results, suggestions, player status, and error handling.
Debouncing mechanism for suggestion fetching to optimize performance.
Event handling for user interactions (search, clicks) and player state changes/errors.
Robust cleanup logic within the YouTubePlayer component to manage the iframe lifecycle alongside React's component lifecycle.

Setup Requirement:
A valid YouTube Data API v3 key must be obtained from the Google Cloud Console and inserted into the
YOUTUBE_API_KEY constant within the src/App.js file for search functionality to work.

Limitations & Considerations:

YouTube Terms of Service: Playback must display the video content; creating an audio-only player violates YouTube's ToS.

Suggestions API: The suggestions feature relies on an undocumented Google endpoint which could change or cease to function without notice.
It also often requires a CORS proxy, which can add unreliability if using public proxies.

API Quotas: Use of the YouTube Data API is subject to daily quotas defined by Google Cloud.

Playback Experience: Video playback includes standard YouTube features like potential ads and is subject to regional restrictions or embedding limitations set by video owners.
